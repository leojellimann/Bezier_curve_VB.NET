With one of my classmate, we had this project of building a software able to draw a Bezier curve in VB.NET.

For the beginning, you can either select 4 points manually by clicking on the graph or by typing the x and y values of each point.

Once you drawn the curve, you can select its color and the number of segments to draw it (impact the curve smooth)

After that, you can save the curve points in an array, save the points in a txt file, save the curve as a picture in your folder or import a curve from a txt file.

All of the program is explained in the pdf file (in french).

Enjoy and don't forget to try the software :)
